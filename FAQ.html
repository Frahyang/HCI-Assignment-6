            What are some of the best dishes?
        </div>
        <div id="panel">
            1. Sushi, Japan
            <p class="edibles">Prepared with vinegared rice and a wide range of ingredients including seafood, vegetables, and sometimes fruits. Sushi tastes best when served with wasabi, pickled ginger, and soy sauce. A popular garnish for this dish is Daikon radish. The type of fish in it defines a sushi's taste. However, the vinegared rice gives the dish a tangy taste overall. Tuna, eel, and Salmon tend to have a light flavour while octopus flavoured sushi is generally strong in taste.</p>
            2. Rendaing, Indonesia
            <p class="edibles">Often called "the world's most delicious dish," Rendang is prepared by simmering beef with coconut milk with a mixture of the best of spices including turmeric, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, chillies, and galangal. The dish is then stewed for a few hours which gives it a tender texture and exotic taste. The blast of flavours is surely one of the reasons why the dish is loved globally and is also one of the best dishes in the world. Easy to rustle up, this dish is often served at ceremonies or to honour guests.</p>
            3. Ramen, Japan
            <p class="edibles">If not tried, you must have heard of Ramen at least once in your life. However, we are not talking about the packaged instant noodles. Ramen is a Japanese dish made of wheat noodles and served in the broth along with vegetables and meat. Ramen comes in several flavours, from tangy to spicy, depending on the flavour of the broth. Every region in Japan has it's own. Tonkotsu, a popular style of ramen includes pork bone broth and the miso ramen, another popular dish originated in Hokkaido.</p>

            What are the recommended drinks to try?
        </div>
        <div id="panel1">
            1. Thai Iced Tea, Thailand
            <p class="edibles">The best tea is served in a plastic bag from street carts, and looks bright orange, but in a good way. It's a strong, sweet caffeine kick, made from strong-brewed black tea and then mixed with condensed milk and spices. If it wasn't any good Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants wouldn't bother stealing the recipe.</p>
            2. Hot Chocolate With Marshmallows, United States
            <p class="edibles">If pina colada equals tropical beaches, then hot chocolate with marshmallows equals extra-thick mitten socks and couch loafing inside ski resorts. This drink is your only legitimate excuse to stay indoors when in the Alps. The rich and aromatic hot chocolate also makes gloomy winter mornings worth looking forward to.</p>
            3. Air Mata Kucing, Malaysia
            <p class="edibles">Malaysians have figured out the golden formula for making a delicious drink - make it sweet, cold and toss in some tropical fruits. Air mata kucing, or longan drink, is exactly that. Sweetened by rock sugar and dried longan, it also comes with winter melon and a cheap price tag.</p>

            What are some of the most spiciest foods in the world?
        </div>
        <div id="panel2">
            1. Suicide Chicken Wings, America
            <p>If you love chicken wings spicy, then this spicy food dish is just right for you. It is not called suicide- chicken-wings for nothing, though! This American appetizer dish is made from a marinade of chopped chilies, hot red-chili sauce, pepper, and more of the red chili flakes. Need any more explanations about the suicide mission? The mix of Korean, Mexican, and Chinese peppers is what the dish contains, and it is no small wonder that it is rightly called a suicide if you are not used to spices at this high level.</p>
            2. Jerk Chicken, Jamaica
            <p>The Jamaicans love the scotch bonnet chilies. And the Jerk Chicken, aka the dish with ‘six side spicy food bombs’ is chicken wings that are Hell-brined, then smoked and finally grilled to perfection in a mix of hot scotch bonnet chili sauce, tons of yellow mustard, and many other fiery spices. The Jamaican meal is incomplete without this iconic meal made of chicken wings marinated in a marinade of habanero peppers as they are called locally, cinnamon, cloves, thyme, nutmeg, garlic, ginger, and green onion stems. It is served with more scotch bonnet chilies sauce, banana and guava ketchup, mustard sauce, and more. Test your tolerance to spice with this freakishly spicy fiery hot dish.</p>
            3. Sichuan Hot-Pot, China
            <p>This spicy food dish is meant to be eaten in the winter months. The Sichuan hot-pot is regularly consumed in winter to improve circulation and can be a soup that is mouth-numbingly fiery on the taste buds. Your craving for hot spicy food ends in the hotpot, which is a melting pot of literally anything available to include in the stew. The main ingredients of this stew are loads of onions, garlic, ginger, Sichuan peppers a variety of pork, beef and other meats, mushrooms, vegetables, duck blood, a pig’s brain, chicken feet, soy sauce, fish sauce and anything else cooked or should we say stewed in a broth filled with peppers and pepper oil. Watch your mouth! Many foreigners have commented they could taste nothing because of the numb mouth for months!</p>
